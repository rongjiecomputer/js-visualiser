# Javascript visualiser
This is a collection of visualisers in javascript.

## Why I wrote these visualiser in javascript
I usually code in C++, but it does not have built-in library for visualiser and I don't want to 
download many libraries that is complicated to use. I tried Java but it does not suit my taste.
Fortunately, I know *a bit* about javascript and it is pretty close to C++, so that is why I create
the visualisers in javascript.
